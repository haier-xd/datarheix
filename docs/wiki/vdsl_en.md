#VDSL
Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL or VHDSL)[1] is a digital subscriber line (DSL) technology providing data transmission faster than asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires (up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream),[2] and on coaxial cable (up to 85 Mbit/s down- and upstream)[3] using the frequency band from 25 kHz to 12 MHz.[4] These rates mean that VDSL is capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television, as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet access, over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring used for analog telephone service and lower-speed DSL connections. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_High_Speed_Digital_Subscriber_Line" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► **If you can get VDSL - Take it!** It is currently the most cost-effective method to produce a live stream. 10-50 Mbit/s Upload are payable fair price for anyone!
