#Surveillance (CCTV)
Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point to point (P2P), point to multipoint, or mesh wireless links. Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, casinos, airports, military installations, and convenience stores. Videotelephony is seldom called "CCTV" but the use of video in distance education, where it is an important tool, is often so called. <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

The use of Zoneminder and/or Motion or the GUI KMotion should be possible with Datarhei/Restreamer as a surveillance streamer. Had no test so far. Take a look at: [Motion und KMotion](/restreamer/wiki/surveillancecctv.html)
