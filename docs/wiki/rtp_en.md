Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) was initially a proprietary protocol developed by Macromedia for streaming audio, video and data over the Internet, between a Flash player and a server. Macromedia is now owned by Adobe, which has released an incomplete version of the specification of the protocol for public use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
