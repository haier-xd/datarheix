#Videocompression
Imagine a green meadow against a cloudless blue sky. On this meadow is a cow and moves. If the cow is moving quite simply transfer the image of the cow often. Meadow and sky do not change so often in the frames and so data can be saved. Very simple principle.

This means that if a lot of moving objects or even large areas of water in the picture are often requires high bandwidth. Even at night, it can lead to increased bandwidth, but this usually is not further bad, as night due to lack of light is nothing to see and the least viewers are awake at night!

**What can cause more bandwidth?**  
Large water surfaces, sea, lakes, rivers  
Trees with many leaves   
Large crowds  
Busy streets  
Night pictures  

**Datarhei Hint** ☺ ► These are empirical values from 10 years live streaming, it can always happen anyway that a stream much more or less uplaod needed (usually more!).  

**Scenarios**  
Rooftops / Still Life / No Movment - less bandwidth  
Scenics - less bandwidth  
Street - more bandwidth  
Beach / sea - a lot of bandwidth  
Night - a lot of bandwidth  
River / Water - a lot of bandwidth  

**Rule of thumb for bandwidth in these scenarios (all upload speed): Static Camera 720p:**
Rooftops 720p → 100 Kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s  
Scenics 720p → 0.5 Kbit/s - 1.2 Mbit/s  
Street 720p → from 0.5 Kbit/s - 2 Mbit/s  
Beach / Sea → from 2-3 Mbit/s  
Night from 2-3 Mbit/s  
River → from 1.5 - 2 Mbit/s  
Event → 0.5 kbit/s -3 Mbit/s  

**At 450 p or 420p you have about 1/2 less data volume - expected 2-4 times more data volume at 1080p.  **

**Datarhei Hint** ☺ ► Rule of thumb is to have at least 1 Mbit/s upload available for a static network camera with 720p Stream. 1080p playing in live streaming currently no major role since the audience side is often (even on mobile devices via mobile network) to cope with the high bandwidths. For PTZ cameras, we recommend you at least. 1-2 Mbit/s upload to have available.
