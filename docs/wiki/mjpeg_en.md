#MJPEG
In Motion JPEG or MJPG full image information is transmitted as a JPG graphic. Unlike H.264 this results in increased data rates for smooth frame rates. Motion JPG streams are rapidly noticed as "bumpy" for the audience. MJPEG is pure 90´es! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► Motion JPEG is supported by Data Rhei. But the encoding requires processing power. Raspberry Pi is not suitable for this. Datarhei/Restreamer relies on [H.264](restreamer/wiki/h264_en) via [RTSP](/restreamer/wiki/rtsp_en.html) to allow even at low bandwidths liquid streaming.
