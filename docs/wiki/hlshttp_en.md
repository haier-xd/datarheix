#HLS
Push, or server push, describes a style of Internet-based communication where the request for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server. It is contrasted with pull/get, where the request for the transmission of information is initiated by the receiver or client. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
