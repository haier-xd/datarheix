#LTE
LTE, an abbreviation for Long-Term Evolution, commonly marketed as 4G LTE, is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. It is based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA network technologies, increasing the capacity and speed using a different radio interface together with core network improvements.The standard is developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) and is specified in its Release 8 document series, with minor enhancements described in Release 9.
LTE is the natural upgrade path for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks. The different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries will mean that only multi-band phones will be able to use LTE in all countries where it is supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Term_Evolution" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> 

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► **G4 definitely pay attention on the data volume when using LTE for streaming!** With G4 you can safely transferred a 450p stream. 720p is relatively expensive with the most data plans. ** TIP: Turn off night and downsize frame rate to 16 FPS helps reduce bandwidth **!
