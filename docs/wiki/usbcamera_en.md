#USB-Video-Device
The USB video device class (also USB video class or UVC) is a USB device class that describes devices capable of streaming video like webcams, digital camcorders, transcoders, analog video converters and still-image cameras.
The latest revision of the USB video class specification carries the version number 1.5 and was defined by the USB Implementers Forum in a set of documents describing both the basic protocol and the different payload formats. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
