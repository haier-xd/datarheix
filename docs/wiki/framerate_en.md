#Framerate (FPS)
Frame rate, also known as frame frequency, is the frequency (rate) at which an imaging device displays consecutive images called frames. The term applies equally to film and video cameras, computer graphics, and motion capture systems. Frame rate is expressed in frames per second (FPS). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>  

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► If you want to reduce your upload bandwith, descend your frame rate down to max. 16 FPS to reduce the amount of data.
