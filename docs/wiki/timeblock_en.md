#Time Block
The manufacturers of PTZ cameras (eg AXIS Communications) work with "Time Block". This is a protective function of the hardware to protect the pan-tilt motor from continuous movements. The hardware is for a specific time (Time) completely inhibited (blocked). ** Only Speed Dome cameras have no time block lock ** If you are using classical [PTZ](/restreamer/wiki/ptz_en.html) cameras take a look at the length of the "Time Block" use imperative to examine how long the lock and when you start.

**Datarhei Hint ☺** ► The "Time Block" in dome cameras can be up to 60 minutes, the camera does not respond in this time. AXIS Communications Dome cameras have a 20 minute time block.
