#Find RTSP URL
How to find the RTSP/RTP URL of your IP camera. First move to the following website and pick up your cam manufacturer and navigate to your camera model: <a href="http://www.soleratec.com/support/rtsp/rtsp_listing" target="_blank">http://www.soleratec.com/support/rtsp/rtsp_listing</a>  

**Attention** - Please take care of the right Username:Password if you deactivated anonymous RTSP/RTP in your camera. The syntax is always the same: rtsp://Username:Passwort@CamIP/ManufacturerLink

How to check the RTSP/RTP link on your local network with VLC:

> 1. Open VLC   
> 2. Open Network
> 3. Insert RTSP URL

**Attention** If you open the RTSP connection for the first time i could take a few seconds until it opens - Be patient! If the stream did not open take a look at the Errormessage protocol in VLC.
