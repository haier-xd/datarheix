#How to support Datarhei?  
The easiest way to support us is certainly to tell everyone how cool you Datarhei is! Share it about your favourite socialmedia page: Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, G+ or whatever your want. â˜º  

A financial method of supporting us is via Social-Payment-Service Flatter <a href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=datarhei&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdatarhei%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://datarhei.org/wiki/pic/flattr-badge-large.png" alt="Flattr this" title="Flattr this" border="0"></a>  
or classic donate with Paypal <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=M7TPT4VN7759G" target="_blank"> <img src="http://datarhei.org/wiki/pic/btn_donate_SM.gif" width="86" height="21" border="0"></a>. 

If you want to do a donation but do not like to use Flattr or Paypal ask us for alternatives ways like direct banc transfer or letter post.

**Dev-Support** If you are a software developer, you can easily upload modules in GitHub and support the Datarhei. Every developer is welcome to join the project.

**Thank you - Feels good to be loved**
